    <!-- form is just an element type like h1, but
    it can be given an action which represents another
    page on the server or broader internet to go to when
    the submit button is pressed. It also can be given a
    method; here, we are using GET, both GET and POST are 
    common methods for submiting data in forms POST is more 
    secrue you can recognize when a site uses GET because 
    data from the form appears in the URL -->
